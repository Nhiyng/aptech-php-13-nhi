    <h3>Early life</h3>
    <p><b>Gerald Earl Gillum</b>, also well-known by the stage name <b>G-Eazy or Young Gerald, is an American rapper and record producer from Oakland, California.</b> 
    <blockquote cite="https://www.biography.com/people/g-eazy-5122017">When he picks up a mic, he is unmistakably hip hop. His rhymes are underpinned by slow southern, trap rhythms and minimal synths, though sung choruses boost his crossover appeal — he makes no apologies for his pursuit of fame.<br>
        Gerald Earl Gillum was born on May 24, 1989. After his parents split when he was in the first grade, Gillum and his brother were raised by their mom — who worked two teaching jobs to keep their heads above water. But money was tight: all three of them shared a room at his grandparents' house.<br>
        It was his mother who first inntroduced him to a life of music and fame, showing him the Beatles film 'A Hard Days Night' during his early years. G-Eazy, who had already decided to have a career in music, did odd jobs at the age of 14 to earn money to pursue his dreams. 
        He attended Berkeley High School, where a group of his peers had a Billboard hit as the hip-hop act the Pack. Gillum has described this as his "seeing-is-believing moment," when he realized that if people he actually knew could succeed, then he could, too. Like the Pack, he had also been making beats — using the music-production software Reason. He sold mixtapes out of his backpack for five bucks each.<br>
